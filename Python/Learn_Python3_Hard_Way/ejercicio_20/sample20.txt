Misumena vatia is a species of crab spider with a holarctic distribution.
In North America, it is called the goldenrod crab spider or flower (crab) spider,[1] as it is commonly found hunting in goldenrod sprays and milkweed plants.
They are called crab spiders because of their unique ability to walk sideways as well as forwards and backwards.
Both males and females of this species progress through several molts before reaching their adult sizes, though females must molt more to reach their larger size.
